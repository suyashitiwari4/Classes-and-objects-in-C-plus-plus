# Aim: To study and implement Classes and Objects

# Apparatus:
VS Code

# Theory:

•	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of thinking about and organizing code for maximum reusability.

•	With this type of programming, a program comprises objects that can interact with the user, other objects, or other programs. 
This makes programs more efficient and easier to understand.

•	Programs made with object-oriented programming are well-organized. 

•	Since relative data and functions are grouped in the same object, it is simple to find what you're looking for and understand the code's fundamental purpose. 

•	Developers new to the project or those revisiting code they have not seen in a while can adapt much faster. 

•	When code is divided into manageable pieces this way, you can avoid overwhelmingly large and complicated files. 

# Algorithm:

 Display Student Details

Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Define a class Student with the following attributes:

name (string)

branch (string)

subject (string)

year (string)

result (float)

Step 3: In the main() function, create two objects: s1 and s2 of class Student.

Step 4: Assign the following values to s1:

name = "Suyashi"

branch = "E&TC"

subject = "C++"

result = 8.6

year = "2024-2028"

Step 5: Assign the following values to s2:

name = "John"

branch = "CSE"

subject = "PPS"

result = 7.9

year = "2024-2028"

Step 6: Print the details of s1 (Name, Branch, Subject, Result, Year).

Step 7: Print the details of s2 (Name, Branch, Subject, Result, Year).

Step 8: End.

Algorithm: Car Information Program

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Define a class Car with the following attributes:

brand (string)

model (string)

year (string)

Step 3: Inside the class, define a method info() that will:

Prompt and read the value of brand.

Prompt and read the value of model.

Prompt and read the value of year.

Step 4: In the main() function:

Create an object c1 of class Car.

Step 5: Call c1.info() to take input for brand, model, and year.

Step 6: Display the values stored in c1 (brand, model, year).

Step 7: End.

 Rectangle Area Calculation

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Define a class rec with data members:

length (integer)

width (integer)

area (integer)

Step 3: Inside the class, define the following methods:

dim() → Input the values of length and width.

calc_area() → Calculate area using the formula:

area=length×width

disp_area() → Display the value of area.

Step 4: In the main() function:

Create an object r of class rec.

Call r.dim() to input dimensions of the rectangle.

Call r.calc_area() to calculate area.

Call r.disp_area() to display area.

Step 5: End.


 Car Information Program

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Define a class Car with the following attributes:

brand (string)

model (string)

year (string)

Step 3: Inside the class, define a method info() that will:

Prompt and read the value of brand.

Prompt and read the value of model.

Prompt and read the value of year.

Step 4: In the main() function:

Create an object c1 of class Car.

Step 5: Call c1.info() to take input for brand, model, and year.

Step 6: Display the values stored in c1 (brand, model, year).

Step 7: End.

 Simple Calculator Using Class

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Define a class Cal with data members:

a (float)

b (float)

Step 3: Inside the class, define methods:

num() → Input values of a and b.

addition() → Compute and display a + b.

subtraction() → Compute and display a - b.

multiplication() → Compute and display a * b.

division() → If b != 0, compute and display a / b; else display error message.

Step 4: In the main() function:

Create an object c of class Cal.

Call c.num() to input values of a and b.

Call c.addition() to display sum.

Call c.subtraction() to display difference.

Call c.multiplication() to display product.

Call c.division() to display quotient or error message.

Step 5: End

# Conclusion:

Hence we have studied and implemented classes and objects.
